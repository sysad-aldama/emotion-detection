# emotion-detection
Detect facial expressions using kaggle dataset
 
The video.py file is runs out the box. 
emotion_detector.py is being tweaked for more accuracy on the predicted emotions
currently its about 70-75% accurate. 

This Artificial Neural Network is has multiple layers, with many weights and nodes. 
I recommend reading on simple tensorflow, sci kit learn, keras, opencv tutorials if you want to know what 'knobs to turn'.
If you want the theory behind these concepts, i recommend visiting 3blue1brown youtube channel. He explains the math and theory very well.
I will write a more proper readme at a later date.

Play around and see peoples reactions to this neat tech!

Enjoy!
